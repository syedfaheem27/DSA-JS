# Questions to practice

## Stacks

- Tree traversals without using recursion
  (Recursion uses function call stack, use stack explicitly as an alternative to that)
- Postfix, Infix and Prefix conversions
- Expression evaluation
- Balanced Parentheses problem✅
- Next Greater Element✅
- Next Smaller Element✅
- Implement stack using 2 queues✅
- Implement the min() function using a Stack✅
- Sort the values in a Stack ✅
- Find the next day with higher temperature
- Decode an encoded string (repeating values encoded with a number)

## Queues

- Level Order Traversal without using recursion✅
- BFS without using recursion✅
- Queue Implementation using a Linked List✅
- Implement a stack using the queue data structure✅
- Implement a queue using the stack data structure / 2 stacks✅
- Reverse first k elements of queue
- Find the moving average of fixed size window
- Implement circular queue ✅
- Implement Dequeue

## Hashing

- Sort a hash map based on keys
- Sort a hash map based on values

## LinkedLists

- Add 1 to a number represented by a linked list✅
- Insert an element into a sorted Circular List✅
- Delete Kth to last element in a Linked List
- Rotate a Linked List✅

### Reverse pattern in linked lists(example problems)

- Check if linked list is a palindrome or not✅
- Reverse the second half of a given linked list

## Binary Trees

**Traversal Techniques**

- Pre-Order
- In Order
- Post Order

**Traversals to practice**

- Level Order
- Zig-Zag Level Order
- Boundary level traversal

## Binary Search Trees

- Range Sum of BST
- Recursive insert in a Binary Search Tree
- Implement a method to convert a binary search tree into a doubly linked list
- Flatten binary tree to a Linked List
- Find kth smallest element in a binary tree
- Find the next greater number in a BST
- BST sequences - all input arrays that can lead to this BST
- Implement Binary Search Tree iterator
- Check if a BST is a valid BST
- Find the 2nd largest element in a BST
