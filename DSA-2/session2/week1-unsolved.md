# Unsolved Questions

**Reverse each word in a string**

- partially done - check session2 Q4 for more details

**Find max sum of triplets in an array containing integers (positive as well as negative)**

    - done for positive - do it for all integers

**Merge two sorted arrays**

    - done in TC - O(M+N) and SC-O(M+N). do it in constant space
    Did in TC - O(m\*n) and SC-O(1). Further optimise runtime-expected
